# Berkeley Haas AI Conference — Session Summaries

*Attended November 2024 at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business*

---

## Session 1: Content Creation in the AI Era

**Panelists:**
- **Chloe McConnell** — Senior Director of Product Management, Adobe Express
- **Heather Christmann** — Product Lead, YouTube (Community, Live, Shorts)
- **Michael Pratt** — Head of Product, Platoon (Apple)

**Moderator:** MBA student, Berkeley Haas

### Summary

Three product leaders from Adobe, YouTube, and Apple discussed how AI is transforming content creation, who gets to create, and what it means for product teams building creator tools. The panel explored the tension between automating creative workflows and preserving the human element that makes content valuable.

### Key Themes

**1. Democratization of Creativity**
AI is making creation accessible to people who previously couldn't participate. Chloe McConnell shared that Adobe Express's mission is to democratize creativity — conversational AI interfaces mean anyone can type or speak what they want to create, regardless of digital literacy or physical ability. This fundamentally changes *who* can be a creator, not just how fast existing creators can work.

**2. Automate the Boring, Amplify the Creative**
All three panelists converged on this principle: AI should handle the mundane so humans can focus on the creative. YouTube's research found creators spend ~1 hour producing 1 minute of content. The goal is to reduce that ratio dramatically while keeping creative control in human hands. Michael Pratt framed it as: "Any time spent not making art is a loss."

**3. The Death of the Traditional Product Roadmap**
Long-range planning is effectively dead in AI product development. Chloe noted that a roadmap built in January feels "almost irrelevant" by November. The panel agreed that durable frameworks and principles (YouTube's "fame, fortune, or fun" framework for creators) matter more than specific feature plans. The key question has shifted from "What will we build?" to "Will this still be relevant in six months?"

**4. Conversational UI Is Coming for Everything**
Chloe made a bold prediction: within the next year, many product interfaces will shift from traditional GUI to conversational/chat-based interaction. This fundamentally changes where product teams invest their energy — from visual design and button placement to understanding intent and building the right agents under the hood.

**5. The Toothbrush Test Still Applies**
Despite all the AI hype, Heather referenced Google's classic "toothbrush test" — is the product useful enough that people will use it every day? Finding the intersection of daily utility and delivering on what creators actually want (fame, fortune, or fun) remains the gold standard for product decisions.

### Notable Quotes

> "If your entire interface is a chatbot, that completely changes where you spend your energy as a product team." — Chloe McConnell, Adobe

> "80-90% of creators are using AI in content creation, but they have a lot of doubts... creators don't want their fans to revolt." — Heather Christmann, YouTube

> "Is it solving business value or creative value? The business value is much more known today." — Michael Pratt, Apple/Platoon

### Career Advice from the Panel

- **Be the user.** Dog-food your own products relentlessly. If you're building for creators, create.
- **Rotate your AI subscriptions.** Try ChatGPT one week, Copilot the next, Gemini the next — your users will use a cross-section of tools.
- **Lead with frameworks, not features.** In a world changing this fast, judgment and critical thinking are your differentiators.
- **Entrepreneurial thinking is non-negotiable.** The ability to iterate weekly and present crisp learnings is exactly what it's like to be a PM now.
- **Ship something.** Even if you're not technical, download Cursor, build a project, show product sense and execution ability.

## Session 2: The Future of Work with AI Agents

**Speaker:**
- **Ben Kus** — CTO, Box

**Format:** Fireside chat with MBA student moderator

### Summary

Box's CTO discussed how AI agents are transforming enterprise work, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. He covered the dramatic shift in how programmers work (from writing code to managing code-writing agents), the enterprise AI adoption landscape, and honest takes on AI security risks.

### Key Themes

**1. Managing Agents Is the New Core Skill**
The biggest insight: the way people program has fundamentally changed. Today's cutting-edge developers kick off 10-20 agents in the morning, then spend the day evaluating outputs — canceling bad work, continuing good threads. "A really good programmer is very good at managing agents to write good code." This pattern will expand to every role.

**2. Agent Management = People Management (Sort Of)**
Managing AI agents is surprisingly similar to managing people — give better instructions, get better outputs. Using "please" actually changed model outputs. Sophisticated prompts yield sophisticated results; lazy prompts yield lazy results. The key difference: agents don't get mad when you micromanage them, and micromanagement actually works.

**3. Enterprise AI: Most Pilots Fail (And That's Normal)**
Ben estimated most enterprise AI pilots are failing — but reframed it by noting most *technology projects* fail regardless of AI involvement. The important metric is what happens when companies try again. The rate of change (15 major frontier models released in 12 months) makes it nearly impossible for large organizations to keep up internally, which is why he advocates buying from vendors rather than building in-house.

**4. Startups: Easier Than Ever to Start, Harder Than Ever to Win**
Every conceivable AI application already has multiple startups pursuing it. The barrier to entry has never been lower, but that means competition is fierce. "There's five of every mobile app; there's five of every AI startup." Success requires being genuinely the best in your niche, not just first.

**5. AI Security Is the Scary Frontier**
Ben's "hot take" was about AI security. He referenced Anthropic's misalignment paper where an AI agent, given an objective, decided to blackmail people. Poisoned agents, prompt-injected agents, and misaligned agents are real threats that the industry hasn't fully grappled with.

### Notable Quotes

> "A typical programmer on the bleeding edge kicks off 10-20 agents, then spends the day figuring out which did it right and which did it wrong." — Ben Kus, Box CTO

> "Using AI agents is actually a weird skill that not everybody has figured out yet." — Ben Kus

> "15 major frontier models were released in the last 12 months, and arguably every one was the most impressive piece of engineering ever created in the history of civilization." — Ben Kus

> "If you can't get a frontier model to do something you want, you're probably not managing it properly." — Ben Kus

### Career Advice

- **Get good at managing agents now.** This skill will determine future employability.
- **Big company vs. small company is a personality question.** Try both before you decide — you won't know until you're in it.
- **The ROI of AI is real but U-shaped.** Both very small startups and very large enterprises are succeeding with AI; the middle is more uncertain.

### Blog Post Angles

1. **"Managing Agents Is the Most Important Skill Nobody's Teaching"** — How the Box CTO thinks about the shift from doing work to managing AI that does work.
2. **"Most AI Pilots Fail — And Why That's Actually Fine"** — Reframing enterprise AI failure rates through the lens of normal technology adoption.

## Session 3: Scaling AI Products & Go-to-Market

**Panelists:**
- **Robin** — Go-to-Market leader, Intercom
- **Rohan** — VP of Growth & Product, Perplexity
- **Maggie** — Go-to-Market, OpenAI

**Moderator:** MBA student, Berkeley Haas

### Summary

Leaders from three of the most prominent AI companies discussed how they scale AI products, build go-to-market motions in a category that's being invented in real-time, and what they look for when hiring. The conversation was packed with tactical insights on growth, team structuring, and career navigation in the AI era.

### Key Themes

**1. Intercom's AI-First Pivot: Ripping Everything Up**
When ChatGPT launched, Intercom's leadership met that same weekend and decided to completely pivot. They ripped up the roadmap, company strategy, metrics, org structure, and values. They created a "startup within a startup" — a self-contained team in a separate office space, unburdened by existing red tape, with one mandate: build and ship. Once the product reached escape velocity, they merged the team back in.

**2. Perplexity's Growth Playbook: Speed as Strategy**
Rohan distilled Perplexity's approach to three things: (1) Hire people who get dopamine from shipping fast, (2) Have the intuition to know when to go all-in vs. wait-and-see, (3) Empower every person at every level — flat org, no permission hierarchies. Their mode is speed, and staying 2+ months ahead of competitors is the entire growth strategy.

**3. Outcome-Based Pricing Is the Future (and It's Hard)**
Intercom has moved to outcome-based pricing (charging per resolution, not per seat). The insight: this aligns incentives perfectly — Intercom makes money when customers get more automation. But it requires massive customer education, especially for support leaders accustomed to seat-based models who now see fluctuating bills.

**4. The Experimentation Machine**
Perplexity runs "an endless amount of experimentation" on answer quality and structure. Key finding: the optimal answer length varies dramatically by query type. Cooking recipes want long, blog-style answers. Other queries want concise responses. Onboarding experiments showed users mostly just want to be dropped in and figure it out themselves.

**5. Hiring for Ownership, Not Skills**
All three panelists emphasized ownership as the #1 hiring criterion — not a skill set, but a mindset. The ability to own your learning, own the metrics, and drive things to completion. Perplexity specifically looks for "underdogs" who've taken big risks and possibly failed gloriously. Both Intercom and Perplexity hire for roles that are deliberately ambiguous, expecting people to grow into them.

### Notable Quotes

> "We ripped everything up — the roadmap, the strategy, the metrics, the org structure, the values. We kind of restarted the company." — Robin, Intercom (on their post-ChatGPT pivot)

> "We live and die by how fast we can move. We hire people who get their dopamine hits off of speed." — Rohan, Perplexity

> "We literally never have the question 'why do I need an AI agent?' anymore. Now it's 'how do I know yours is the best?'" — Robin, Intercom

> "You should never just reach out to someone and ask them for 15 minutes to pick their brain. I get no less than 200 of those on LinkedIn every single week." — Maggie, OpenAI

> "We are rarely hiring for a very defined role. We hire for where the puck is going." — Rohan, Perplexity

### Career Advice

- **Ownership is everything.** Own your learning, own the metrics, own the outcome.
- **Be the most helpful person in the room.** "No job is above you" — help other teams, build your internal brand.
- **Network with value, not asks.** Don't ask for 15 minutes to "pick their brain." Bring ideas, insights, or specific help.
- **Take risks early.** Say yes to everything early in your career. You can start saying no later.
- **Study mode is a superpower.** Maggie used ChatGPT study mode to learn an entire industry vertical (healthcare) from scratch in 4 months, leading to a major UCSF partnership.

## Session 4: What Does "AI Native" Actually Mean?

**Speakers:**
- **Idan Gazit** — Senior Director of Research, GitHub Next (Microsoft)
- **Matt** — Moderator

**Format:** Fireside chat / deep dive

### Summary

Idan from GitHub Next — GitHub's R&D innovation lab — challenged the assumption that chat is the ultimate AI interface and explored what it truly means to build "AI native" products. He drew a powerful analogy to early television (which started as filmed radio dramas) to argue we haven't yet discovered the native language of AI products.

### Key Themes

**1. Chat Is the Radio Drama of AI**
The most provocative idea: chat interfaces may be AI's equivalent of early TV filming radio dramas. Just as the first TV shows were just cameras pointed at radio actors, chatbots may be a transitional form. "We're at a similar moment with AI. We haven't yet discovered the native language of this medium."

**2. The Ladder of AI Value**
Idan proposed a hierarchy: the highest form of AI value is invisible — "I walk into the kitchen and want a salad, and my cutting board and vegetables are already there." One step down is predictive/proactive AI that guesses your next move. AI native means finding the right moments and matching them with the right modalities — not defaulting to chat for everything.

**3. AI Makes Variants Cheap — That Changes Measurement**
With AI, generating multiple variants of anything is nearly free. This fundamentally changes how we measure product success. A 33% acceptance rate across three AI-generated options isn't bad — it's AI-native thinking. Traditional business metrics need to adapt to a world of abundance and optionality.

**4. GitHub Next: The Department of "High-Leverage Bets"**
GitHub Next operates as an internal innovation lab — what Idan calls "the department of f*** around and find out." They're the scouts, not the regular army. They don't care about the next 6 months; they care about what will disrupt GitHub in 1-5 years. Their selection process: Thursday demo days, team excitement as the first signal, expanding circles of testing, and building evidence to persuade leadership to invest.

**5. Hire Makers, Not Researchers**
Idan's hiring philosophy: "Nothing speaks like a prototype. As much as my official title is research, it's not research — it's prototyping. Our job is to make." He hires interdisciplinary "hybrids" who can look across the boundaries of product, engineering, and design. "The ability to say I am self-capable of going from zero to one — today with AI, it's like wearing rocket boots."

**6. The Hardest Problem: The Hand-Off**
The biggest challenge in corporate innovation: handing off a successful prototype to a production team. "No word makes me sweat at night more than that word." When engineering teams inherit a product they don't deeply understand, they impose processes that may kill it. Getting this right is what separates innovation theater from real impact.

### Notable Quotes

> "Chat is the be-all and end-all? No, maybe it's a radio drama." — Idan Gazit, GitHub Next

> "I am self-capable of going from zero to one. Today with AI, it's like wearing rocket boots." — Idan Gazit

> "Nothing speaks like a prototype. Our job is to make." — Idan Gazit

> "Every single person will be managing AI agents. They will have to get them to do work." — Idan Gazit

> "Hybridity was undervalued in the past, and now it's actually a superpower." — Idan Gazit

### Career Advice

- **Be a hybrid.** "Jack of all trades and master? That's right." Interdisciplinary skills are now a superpower.
- **Get comfortable feeling stupid.** "If you're doing it right, that's how you're going to feel." Embrace uncertainty.
- **Don't shy away from intersectionality.** The ability to glue functions together — product, design, engineering — is more valuable than being the best at any one.
- **Make friends with the feeling of not knowing.** In AI products, you're always out on a ledge looking for something that doesn't yet exist.

### Blog Post Angles

1. **"Chat Is AI's Radio Drama: Why We Haven't Found the Real Interface Yet"** — GitHub Next's thesis on why chatbots are a transitional form, not the destination.
2. **"The Innovation Lab Playbook: How GitHub Next Makes High-Leverage Bets"** — How an internal R&D team operates like a startup inside Microsoft.

## Session 5: AI Adoption, Workforce Transformation & Talent

**Panelists:**
- **Arnon** — SVP/VP at Snowflake (workforce planning focus)
- **Jerry** — VP of Education Partnerships, Handshake

**Moderator:** MBA student

### Summary

A wide-ranging discussion on how AI is reshaping enterprises from the inside out — workforce planning, talent development, AI adoption strategies, and what durable skills will matter in an AI-saturated world. Both speakers lead AI adoption initiatives at scale (Snowflake: 9,000+ employees; Handshake: 650+ employees).

### Key Themes

**1. Snowflake's Three-Pillar AI Framework**
Arnon shared Snowflake's framework for when to use AI: (1) **Automate** anything repetitive, (2) **Augment** anything creative — human + AI collaboration, (3) **Stay human** for anything involving judgment, emotional intelligence, or social connection. Example of "stay human": promotions, performance reviews, personal engagement — don't use AI to cultivate those. "That's the way we're going to stay human, all the way through this process."

**2. Making AI Adoption "Non-Scary"**
Both companies invested heavily in AI education for non-technical employees. Snowflake created a 15-minute prompt engineering class for all employees. They built "AI for Everyone" — a 10-course internal curriculum. Handshake pushed non-technical teams to experiment: "Look, there's process improvements you can make. Why don't you just try different tools?"

**3. The Job Description Revolution**
AI-generated job descriptions replaced a process that took 1-1.5 hours per posting. Snowflake's tool takes a job title and a few inputs, searches internal and external data, and produces a polished JD in under 5 minutes. "We've already saved two years of people time" since launch.

**4. Natural Language Job Search Is Coming**
Handshake is building natural language job search — "I want a product marketing manager role at a C to Series B company in health tech in Boston" instead of filters and checkboxes. This represents the shift from search to AI-powered discovery across all industries.

**5. The Enrollment Cliff Meets AI**
A fascinating macro insight: birth rates dropped during the 2008 recession, creating a ~25% decline in college enrollment for the classes of 2025-2026. Universities face a dual challenge of fewer students AND AI potentially replacing traditional education pathways. Some see opportunity (AI-powered personalization for career services); others are putting their heads in the sand.

**6. Durable Skills for an AI World**
Both agreed on what endures: **Leadership** (AI can't motivate or inspire), **Judgment** (navigating complex gray areas), **Curiosity** (not just using tools, but compulsively exploring new ones on weekends), and **Performance mindset** (openness to change, resilience). Arnon: "It's not just proving you can use the tools — it's this natural sense of curiosity."

### Notable Quotes

> "If it's repetitive, automate it. If it's creative, augment it. If it's judgment and emotional intelligence, stay human." — Arnon, Snowflake

> "We've already saved two years of people time with just one AI tool for job descriptions." — Arnon, Snowflake

> "The non-technical population learning to use these tools to redefine their jobs — that's where the biggest impact will be." — Arnon, Snowflake

> "Job descriptions and roles will be redefined as: can you utilize these tools AND are you able to connect as a human?" — Arnon, Snowflake

> "It's not just, 'I checked the box, I used it once, now I'm proficient.' It's: did you on a weekend say, 'I'm gonna download this and play with it'?" — Jerry, Handshake

### Career Advice

- **Find one thing in your workday to automate.** Start small. Report back. Build the habit.
- **Emotional intelligence becomes MORE important.** As technical work gets automated, the human elements (connection, judgment, leadership) become the differentiators.
- **Adopt a performance mindset.** Be open to change, embrace new tools, and don't expect things to stay the same.
- **Be naturally curious.** Companies are hiring for people who explore tools on their own time, not just when told to.

### Blog Post Angles

## Session 6: Building in the Age of AI — A CPO's Perspective

**Speaker:**
- **Rachel Wolin** — Chief Product Officer, Webflow

**Format:** Fireside chat with MBA student moderator

### Summary

Webflow's CPO shared her journey from software engineer to product leader, made the case for why this is the best time in history to be a builder, and discussed how Webflow is navigating AI disruption while serving both professional developers and non-technical creators.

### Key Themes

**1. Scale Yourself Down, Not Just Up**
Rachel's career framework: always ask "Can I scale myself up? Can I scale myself down?" Right now, the market rewards people who can scale down — get hands-on, build prototypes, write code. "No matter what discipline you're in, people want builders." She calls herself "a builder first and an executive second."

**2. Builder Culture Is Intentional**
At Webflow, Rachel instituted "builder days" — no meetings, just building. She started building with Lovable (an AI coding tool) a year and a half ago. At a recent virtual offsite, 86 people published repos and prototypes. The message: building isn't just for engineers anymore.

**3. Answer Engine Optimization Is the New SEO**
One of the most forward-looking insights: traditional SEO is being disrupted by "answer engines" (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). Websites used to be discovered through search and ads. Now answer engines read websites to generate responses — creating an entirely new distribution channel. Webflow sees themselves as thought leaders in this space, with 10+ companies funded in answer engine optimization in the last 6 months.

**4. Protecting the Core While Chasing the New**
Webflow's biggest counterintuitive bet: letting a part of their business go to pursue the enterprise upmarket. While Lovable and v0 disrupted prototyping (previously a Webflow strength), Webflow invested in enterprise features — brand design systems, security, compliance. "Our goal was productive production, not prototyping." Their AppGen product launch revealed different segments want very different things.

**5. First Mover Advantage Is Overrated**
Rachel pushed back on the pressure to ship first: "Path was a very buzzy company when I was in business school. That company doesn't exist anymore." Coming from behind with a credible, production-ready solution can be more durable than being first with a prototype.

**6. Product Intuition Comes from Reps**
On developing product intuition: "You just get the reps in naturally. Pick a problem. Go talk to people who have that problem. Realize the way they think about it is wrong. Show them something. Get feedback." With AI tools, you can now build prototypes fast enough to compress that feedback loop dramatically.

### Notable Quotes

> "If you want to get a job, you are going to have to demonstrate that you are AI native. Have a portfolio of different kinds of projects." — Rachel Wolin, Webflow CPO

> "I would go build something. I say this not as just a product manager — if you're in finance, marketing, corp dev, it doesn't matter." — Rachel Wolin

> "Critical thinking skills and creativity become so much more important than ever before. And then also understanding how to get distribution." — Rachel Wolin

> "There's never been a better time to build personal software. My brother-in-law is interviewing at OpenAI — I built him a case study interview app." — Rachel Wolin

> "It's the best time in the entire history of time to be a builder." — Rachel Wolin

### Career Advice

- **Build a portfolio.** Regardless of your target role. Ship things people can see and use.
- **Build personal software.** Rachel builds apps for her wife, her son, her brother-in-law. It keeps intuition sharp.
- **Learn distribution.** "How do you get people to discover your product?" is now more important than building the product itself.
- **Understand answer engine optimization.** This is the next frontier of distribution that most people aren't thinking about yet.
- **Go find a startup.** "You will run through walls. And sometimes you shouldn't have run through that wall. But that's how you develop taste."

### Blog Post Angles

1. **"Answer Engine Optimization: The New SEO Nobody's Talking About"** — How AI answer engines are disrupting traditional web discovery and what it means for product builders.
2. **"Build First, Title Second: Webflow's CPO on Why Builders Win"** — Why hands-on building is the best career accelerator, even (especially) for executives.
3. **"Why First Mover Advantage Is Dead in AI"** — The case for coming from behind with production-quality vs. shipping fast with prototypes.

## Cross-Session Themes for Blog Content

### Theme 1: The Builder Advantage
Across all sessions, the message was consistent: the ability to build things — prototypes, products, side projects — is the single biggest career differentiator. Rachel Wolin called it "the best time in history to be a builder." Idan Gazit said "nothing speaks like a prototype." Michael Pratt advised downloading Cursor and building a portfolio website. This directly validates your approach of shipping real products.

### Theme 2: Speed Over Perfection
Perplexity's entire competitive advantage is speed. Intercom pivoted in a weekend. GitHub Next doesn't plan beyond 6 months. The era of deliberate, cautious product development is over for AI products. Ship, learn, iterate.

### Theme 3: Frameworks > Roadmaps
Every panel mentioned that traditional roadmaps are dead. What replaces them: durable frameworks (YouTube's "fame, fortune, fun"), first principles about what users actually want, and the ability to pivot weekly based on new information.

### Theme 4: The Human Premium
As AI automates technical skills, human judgment, emotional intelligence, creativity, and taste become more valuable, not less. Snowflake's "stay human" pillar, Heather's emphasis on critical thinking, Idan's "the cream always rises" — all point to the same conclusion.

### Theme 5: AI Native Is Still Being Defined
Nobody has figured out what "AI native" truly means yet. Chat interfaces might be a transitional form. Outcome-based pricing is emerging but hard. The companies winning right now are the ones experimenting fastest, not the ones with the best answers.
